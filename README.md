## Purpose
Realtime chat with automatic translation.

## Planning
- Decide on whether to use React or Vue
- Chats aren't stored
- Firebase or Netlify
- Try serverless?
- Authentication for later
- DeepL for translation - Documentation: https://www.deepl.com/docs-api - API Domain: api-free.deepl.com
- Decide on websocket - socket.io?

## User Stories
React to create this web app.  I'll use DeepL for the translation. Socket.io for the websocket.  MongoDB atlas to store user profile details (username and language).

I want to be able to set my username and language without registering so other users can chat with me when I go to the site.  

I want to be able to chat with someone else by selecting the language then it matches me with someone who is online and isn't in a chat already who has that language on their profile.

I can chat with that person in my language (set when I created the user profile) and when I send a message it translates it for them and vice versa
